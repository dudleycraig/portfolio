## Overview

15+ years full-stack. Clojure being preeminent. Previous experience spread across Java, Javascript, Typescript, PHP, C and Perl.<br>
Industries being fintech, media and commerce via both web and mobile.<br>
My experience is deep, across many technologies. My freelance bread and butter is made up of monorepo API backends and SPA/PWA frontends primarily using a Integrant, Reagent/Re-Frame, Datomic/Datascript, specs and CLI tools tying the stack together with some time savings from Clojure MCP.<br>
Simple is reliable.<br>
I’m based in South Africa (+2 GMT) with interests in GIS, 3D Modelling and ML/AI. When I can drag myself away from the laptop I labour through open water swimming and trail running.
